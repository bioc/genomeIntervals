CHANGES IN VERSION 1.22.1
--------------------------

  o Fixed an issue in the formatting of the coordinates in the
  writeGff3 function

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.22.0
--------------------------

  o Bioc Version 3.0

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.21.1
--------------------------

  o Ported version 1.20.1 changes

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20.1
--------------------------

  o Added an argument to the readGff3 function to
  enable quietness.

  o Corrected some R CMD check warnings

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.3
--------------------------

  o genome intervals order now consisten with assumption that (start == [start-1 and that stop) == stop-1]

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.2
--------------------------
	o Depends on intervals >=0.14.0 to fix a change in R's split behavior
	o sort does not have byName argument any longer

NEW FEATURES
	o order, sort, rank and xtfrm consistently implemented.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.1
--------------------------

	o Created that NEWS file to replace the
	CHANGES file and be compliant to the R
	standard package architecture

NEW FEATURES

    o introduced a coercion to data.frame
    o introduced a writeGff3 function
    o reverted the sort behavior to the default R behavior
    and added a method argument. Setting it to byName results
    in a more biologically relevant sorting of the object.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.4
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o annotation and annotation<- now from BiocGenerics. Thanks to Nicolas Delhomme.

BUG FIXES

    o in interval_union use full argument name (levels instead of level)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.4
--------------------------

	o updated Julien's email address


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.4
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o added a 'which_nearest' method for Genome_intervals objects


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.1
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o strand and strand<- now from BiocGenerics. Thanks to Nicolas Delhomme.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.5
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o show only show the 1st 4 rows and the last 4 rows of a genomeIntervals

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.4
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

   o Added a 'sort' method for 'Genome_intervals' objects

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.3
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES

   o Added a new user-friendly constructor function 'GenomeIntervals'
     for constructing both 'Genome_intervals' and
     'Genome_intervals_stranded' objects

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2
--------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o regular expression in the extract method (called by parseGffAttributes()) fixed to make sure any key is at the beginning of after a ';'

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.1
--------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o The package does not "Depends" on Biobase but only "Imports" it.
    o readGff3 deals with Gff having only "+" strand entries (bug report from Nicolas Servant) as well as "?" strand entries
