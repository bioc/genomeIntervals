Changes in version 1.7.4:

   o Added a 'sort' method for 'Genome_intervals' objects

Changes in version 1.7.3:

   o Added a new user-friendly constructor function 'GenomeIntervals' 
     for constructing both 'Genome_intervals' and
     'Genome_intervals_stranded' objects

Ver. 1.7.2:
	regular expression in the extract method (called by parseGffAttributes()) fixed to make sure any key is at the beginning of after a ';'
